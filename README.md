# CIFAR10_Classification_CNN
Here we will train a CNN network on the CIFAR-10 dataset built using Keras. This dataset has 10 classes of 60,000 RGB images each of size (32, 32, 3). The 10 classes are aeroplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck. 
We will be using Batch Normalization, Max Pooling and Dropouts.
